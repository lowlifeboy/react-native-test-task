# Test Task App

Clone this branch and commit your work there.

Create an app with 2 available screens.

Screen 1:

- nav bar at the bottom with 2 equal-sized rectangles (use this lib: https://github.com/aksonov/react-native-router-flux)
- title at the top of the screen
- list of videos to choose from

Screen 2:

- title becomes the name of the video
- nav bar stays the same
- create video player (use this lib: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video)

Clicking on any video should proceed to Screen 2. Make it possible to go to Screen 1 using an arrow.
